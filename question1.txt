The <br> tag in HTML is used to create a line break in the text,causing the content that follows it to appear on a new line.If we remove the <br> tag, the text "I am learning HTML." will not have a line break after it. Instead, it will continue on the same line as the rest of the paragraph. The page layout will change in that the paragraph will not have an extra line break, and the text will be displayed on a single line.
